### Skewness
Skewness measures the symmetry of a dataset's distribution. Think of it as a way to describe if your data "leans" more to one side:

Zero skewness: The data is perfectly symmetrical (like a bell curve).
Positive skewness: The tail on the right side is longer or fatter, meaning there are more extreme values on the higher end.
Negative skewness: The tail on the left side is longer or fatter, meaning there are more extreme values on the lower end.
## Why is it useful?
Skewness tells you if your data might be biased in some way. For example:

In finance, it can indicate if returns are more likely to be above or below average.
In quality control, it might show if a manufacturing process is producing more high or low outliers.

### Kurtosis
Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of a distribution or how extreme the outliers are.

High kurtosis: The data has heavy tails, meaning there are more extreme outliers.
Low kurtosis: The data has light tails, meaning fewer outliers.
Normal kurtosis: A distribution with kurtosis close to 3 (when measured as "excess kurtosis," it is 0).
## Why is it useful?
Kurtosis helps understand the risk of rare but extreme events:

In risk management, high kurtosis might indicate a higher chance of extreme financial losses.
In machine learning, it can highlight if preprocessing is needed to handle unusual data points.
## In short:

Skewness: Do the data lean left, right, or stay centered?
Kurtosis: How likely are extreme outliers?
